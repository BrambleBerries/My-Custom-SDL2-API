WIP, this project doesn't do anything useful

The aim is to make SDL behave like processing, which would make using SDL2 more intuitive to ME. I'm doing this since I don't like the java in processing and don't like the amount of writing you need in SDL2. If you don't know processing specific syntax this repo is probably useless to you anyway.

You will still need to add SDL/SDL2 to the project: https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/Installation 
Follow some tutorial on how to get started with SDL2: some stuff goes in src/include, some in src/lib
SDL2.dll goes in project folder
